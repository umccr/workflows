# RNA-seq report workflow

RNA-seq report workflow is designed to post-process, summarise and visualise an output from *[bcbio-nextgen](https://github.com/bcbio/bcbio-nextgen)* *[RNA-seq pipeline](https://bcbio-nextgen.readthedocs.io/en/latest/contents/pipelines.html#rna-seq)*. Its main application is to complement genome-based findings from [umccrise](https://github.com/umccr/umccrise) pipeline and to provide additional evidence for detected alterations.
